Machine learning techniques have deeply rooted in our everyday life. However, since it is knowledge- and labor-intensive to go pursue good learning performance, humans are heavily involved in every aspect of machine learning. To make machine learning techniques easier to apply and reduce the demand for experienced human experts,  application of automated machine learning  has emerged as a hot topic with both industrial and academic interest. In this project, we try to implement some of the most common machine learning algorithms which actually perform decent on most kinds of data. This is a platform where even amateurs can utilise the power of machine learning algorithms to obtain quick regression and classification results. In simple words we can call it as a plug and play platform for simple machine learning problems
